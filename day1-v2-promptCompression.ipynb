This authorization is for no more than six contracts, which must be awarded by June 30th, 2022.

Again, it's really just following the recommendations of an already studied issue, which which demonstrates a disparity between minority contractors or women contractors receiving contracts in the city of Boston. So this would allow for us to shepherd and move these six contracts to those already designated groups who have a disadvantage. And I think it's. Really fulfilling a promise. Of making sure that we go through and make sure all aspects of the city government, including the financial benefits, are accessible to people in the city of Boston. I recommend that this pass and I hope that my colleagues will vote for it. Thank you. Thank you so much. Councilor Edward seeks acceptance of the committee report and passage of Docket 1239.
